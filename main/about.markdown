<p> Hi! I'm Andira Gita Nawangsari! An aspiring machine learning engineer and data scientist that currently resides in East Java, Indonesia. My previous project was ranging from NLP for sentiment analysis, data analytics, and machine learning for the shipping terminal domain. </p>

I enjoy reading so so much, especially novels and English literature. Really love Agatha Christie and currently stuck in Edgar Allan Poe's work (will update this sentence every once in a while!). I love having friends to discuss books so don't hesitate to add me as a friend on Goodreads!
